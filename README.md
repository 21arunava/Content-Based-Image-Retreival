# Content-Based-Image-Retreival
The aim of this project is to review the current state of the art in content-based image retrieval (CBIR), a technique for retrieving images on the basis of automatically-derived features such as color, texture and shape. My ﬁndings are primary based both on a review of the relevant literature and on exploring possible enhancements over the net.The need to ﬁnd a desired image from a collection is shared by many professional groups, including journalists, design engineers and art historians. While the requirements of image users can vary considerably, it can be useful to characterize image queries into three levels of abstraction: primitive features such as color or shape, logical features such as the identity of objects shown and abstract attributes such as the signiﬁcance of the scenes depicted. While CBIR systems currently operate eﬀectively only at the lowest of these levels, most users demand higher levels of retrieval.
